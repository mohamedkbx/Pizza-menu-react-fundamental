# React Fundamentals Project

This project focuses on mastering the core concepts of React, particularly in:

- Component creation and reuse
- Conditional rendering
- List rendering
- Props
- JSX
- Separation of Concerns (SoC)

Throughout this project, you'll build various components that encapsulate specific functionality, allowing for clean and maintainable code. You'll learn how to pass data between components using props, making them dynamic and reusable.

You'll also practice conditional rendering to display different content based on application state, as well as rendering lists from arrays of data using JSX. By completing this project, you
will gain hands-on experience with React's fundamental building blocks, ensuring a strong foundation for more advanced topics.

Separation of Concerns (SoC) refers to the practice of organizing your code into distinct, manageable parts, where each part handles a specific responsibility or functionality. This improves maintainability, scalability, and clarity in your codebase. In the context of React, it means separating concerns like UI components, state management, and data fetching into different parts of your application. Let's break this down:
